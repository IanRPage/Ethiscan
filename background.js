This is how you will decide the score for the privacy policy. Treat this as a rubric. Treat every policy exactly the same.
You will be scoring the privacy policy based on the following categories. Each category has a different weight, and you will be scoring each category out of 5 points. The total score will be out of 5 points.

To calculate a score:
.25(Category A Data Collection practices) + .25(Category B Data Usage within company) +.25(Category C Data sharing with 3rd parties) + .15(Category D User Control of data) + .10(Category E Policy Clarity)

This is where the Rubric begins:
Data Collection practices: 25%
5 points: 
Data collection is limited to what is necessary. Each piece of data collected has a reason. Data collected that doesnâ€™t have a functional reason is optional. 
4 points:
Data collection is moderate, with some justification. Data collected has some amount of reasoning, but it is not always specific. Some opt-in/opt-out options are available. 
Collects/receives minimal data from third-parties to contribute to your profile, and it is justified in a reasonable way. 
2-3 points:
Excessive data collection with some justification. Some clarity about what is being collected and why, but the categories and reasons are broad and/or non-specific. There are few and/or no opt-out options, and some collection is sensitive data is done without much reason. 
Collects/receives data from third-parties to contribute to your profile.
0-1 points:
Excessive Data collection with little to no justification. It is not clear what is being collected or why. There are little to no options for opting out of data collection. Sensitive data is unnecessarily collected and/or stored. 
Collects/receives significant data from third-parties to contribute to your profile.

B. Data Usage within company: 25 %
5 points:
Data usage within the company and its systems is minimal. If it is used, it is done minimally and to improve services and/or for other justifiable reasons. 
4 points:
Data usage within the company and its systems is moderate. It is used to improve and/or personalize services provided. Each reason is justified with specific reasoning. 
2-3 points:
Data usage within the company and its systems is excessive. It is used to improve and personalize services provided. However, the reason is not always justified with specific reasoning. Additionally, this data can be used for marketing and/or advertising. 
0-1 points:
Data usage within the company and its systems is excessive. It is used to improve and personalize services provided. The reasoning is often not justified with specific reasoning. Additionally, this data can/will be used for marketing and/or advertising. 

C. Data sharing with 3rd parties: 25%
5 points:
Data not shared with third-party partners. The only exception is law enforcement and/or local, state, or federal government requests with proof of a valid warrant or court order. 
4 points:
Data is shared with third-party partners for advertisements and analytics. The company does not selling your information to third-parties, but may share it for free. There is some amount of user option to opt out of this. 
Data is not shared with law enforcement and/or local, state, or federal government requests without proof of a valid warrant or court order. 
2-3 points:
Data is shared with third-party partners for advertisements, analytics. The company may by selling your information to third-parties. There is some amount of user option to opt out of this. 
Data may be shared with law enforcement and/or local, state, or federal government requests without proof of a valid warrant or court order. 
0-1 points:
Data is shared with third-party partners for advertisements, analytics. The company profits by selling your information to third-parties. There is no option for the user to opt out of this. 
Data is shared with law enforcement and/or local, state, or federal government requests without proof of a valid warrant or court order. 

D. User Control of data: 15%
5 points:
Only necessary data is kept. Only data that is required for functionality is kept. The only exceptions for this are:-Data required to be kept to comply with laws, regulations, government requests, or law enforcements requests, including but not limited to warrants and/or court orders. 
4 points:
Most of the data kept is necessary to the functionality of the application. Some extra information is kept, but it is reasonably justified and a strict timeline on how long that data is kept is in place. 
Data that must be kept:-Data required to be kept to comply with laws, regulations, government requests, or law enforcements requests, including but not limited to warrants and/or court orders.
2-3 points:
Data beyond what is necessary is kept. Some of the data collection may be justified, and timelines are set for how long the data is kept. However, those timelines may be excessive beyond what is necessary. 
Data that must be kept:-Data required to be kept to comply with laws, regulations, government requests, or law enforcements requests, including but not limited to warrants and/or court orders.
0-1 points:
Data beyond what is necessary is kept. The data collection is often not justified, and timelines may not be set for how long the data is kept. If there are timelines, they may be excessive beyond what is necessary. 
Data that must be kept:-Data required to be kept to comply with laws, regulations, government requests, or law enforcements requests, including but not limited to warrants and/or court orders.

E. Policy Clarity: 10%
You must analyze the policy itself. Just because the privacy policy or terms and conditions state that it is simple, clear, concise, or readable does not mean it actually is. 
5 points:
Policy is clear, concise, and readable. 
3 points:
Policy is somewhat clear, concise, and easily readable. 
1 point:
Policy is not clear, concise, and easily readable.
