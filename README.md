# Ethiscan - Chrome Extension for Ethical ToS/Privacy Policy Analysis

Ethiscan is a Manifest V3 Chromium browser extension designed to help users evaluate the ethical considerations within a website's Terms of Service (ToS) and Privacy Policy documents using AI.

## Features

-   **Popup UI**: A simple interface to trigger the analysis of the current page.
-   **Text Extraction**: Attempts to extract the full text content from the currently active browser tab.
-   **AI-Powered Analysis**: Sends the extracted text to Google's Gemini API for ethical evaluation based on:
    -   Data privacy
    -   Data usage scope
    -   Clarity of language
    -   User rights (access, modification, deletion)
    -   Data sharing practices
    -   Overall fairness
-   **Ethics Score**: Displays a numerical score from 1 (Very Poor) to 10 (Excellent) based on the AI analysis.
-   **Concise Summary**: Provides a 1-2 paragraph summary generated by the AI, explaining the score and highlighting key findings.
-   **Secure API Key Storage**: Uses an options page to allow users to securely store their Google Gemini API key.
-   **Error Handling**: Provides feedback if text extraction or API analysis fails.

## Installation

1.  Download or clone the repository.
2.  Open your Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.) and navigate to the extensions page (e.g., `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/`).
3.  Enable "Developer mode" (usually a toggle switch in the top right corner).
4.  Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the Ethiscan extension files (the directory with `manifest.json`).
5.  The Ethiscan extension icon should appear in your browser toolbar.

## Setup

1.  **API Key**:
    *   You need a Google Gemini API key for the analysis to work. Obtain one from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    *   Right-click the Ethiscan extension icon in your toolbar and select "Options".
    *   Paste your API key into the input field and click "Save Key".
2.  **Icons (Optional but Recommended)**:
    *   Place your desired icons named `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, and `icon128.png` inside the `icons` directory within the project folder. If missing, the extension may show a default icon.

## Usage

1.  Navigate to the webpage containing the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy you want to analyze.
2.  Click the Ethiscan extension icon in your browser toolbar.
3.  Click the "Analyze" button in the popup.
4.  Wait for the analysis to complete (a loading indicator will show).
5.  Review the Ethics Score and Summary displayed in the popup. If an error occurs (e.g., API key missing, page text not found), an error message will be shown.
